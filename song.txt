Nigga, my gun go off - you see the barrel turning
You feel the hollows burning, nigga, now you're learning
Nigga, my gun go off - call it attempted murder
Nigga, I'm trying to murk you when I come back busting
Nigga, my gun go off - don't try to say I'm tripping
When I get to flipping and I smack the clip in
Nigga, my gun go off - we call it putting work in
Leaving niggas hurting, homicide's lurking
Nigga, my gun go off

Fuckboy, you can see it to believe it
Try to dodge and weave it, end up a paraplegic
Believe me, its easy, I'll hurt you, I'll murk you
I'll pop something, drop something, I ain't going to stop hunting
Run, run, 'til you're spun, one shot, one gun
One 911 emergency, it's murder, B
It's excellent execution when I'm pulling the trigger
No mistake for that cake, I'm hitting you and your niggas
Feel the flame when I aim for the top of your brain
See the spark and the bang, nigga, shit ain't a game
Do the math or get blast, bullets go through the glass
Goes through your ass fast and the leather seat in your Nav
Nigga, its not a war when there's casualties on one side, I ride
Turn it up on you nigga after Jake ride by
I click-clack, that's that, I don't flash, I mash
I wave the Uzi at them, I make a movie out them
